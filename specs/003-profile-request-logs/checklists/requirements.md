- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- Validation pass 1 (2026-08-17): all items pass.
- 2026-08-17 specify update: request/response bodies and per-row copy-cURL added; earlier "bodies out of scope" assumption reversed and recorded in Clarifications. Checklist re-checked — still 16/16.
- Informed defaults: 64 KB text-body cap; binary bodies not shown; copy-cURL uses stored (redacted) headers and request body only; dedicated logs-tab start/pause; 200-entry cap; local-only; Headers tab is always the landing tab.
- Ready for `/speckit-plan`. Use `/speckit-clarify` if any assumed default should change.
